  <h3>Baby class professional web development </h3>
  <p>
    I'm a new web developer,and I'm still in baby class.
    I've a big dream in my life.My dream is none to me at all.Because I'm a very lazy and stady.I always belive that I can do any thing if I give full try to it.
    If you are a new web developer don't think about how much you are gonna income in future.Don't think it is very easy to learn.You have to manage time for it.You have to give minimum 4 hours in a day to learn web development properly.

       <h3 class="orange-highlight">2021-Present | Pro level Web Developer</h3>
       <p>Full-stack developers are experts in both the front-end and back-end; so, the full stack of technology that makes up a website. They are proficient in both front-end and back-end languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. </p>

    <h2>Baby Web Developer</h2>
    <h3 class="orange-highlight">2020-2021 | Programming Hero learner/h3>
      <p>This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how the information in your website is laid out in browsers and on mobile devices as well. A dedicated front-end developer will be very experienced working with HTML and CSS as well as the scripting language, JavaScript. With these languages, the developer can very efficiently manipulate the information on a website to make it appealing and effective.</p>
